# Labrador Sea Convection

This modeling project investigates how freshwater input from glacial melt affects deep convection in the Labrador Sea and its potential impact on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In particular, I will explore the following science question:

**How does freshwater input affect deep water formation in the Labrador Sea?**

To investigate this question, I will construct a regional ocean model of the Labrador Sea and run two experiments: one control simulation without additional freshwater input and another with a prescribed freshwater anomaly representing glacial meltwater from Greenland. The simulations will be idealized and run for several years of model time to allow the effects of stratification and deep convection to develop.

Initial and boundary conditions will be adapted from climatological fields, and bathymetry will be extracted from the GEBCO global topography dataset. The model will include surface forcing from wind stress and heat fluxes, and the freshwater forcing will be applied in a localized region along the Greenland coast. I anticipate that the experiment with freshwater forcing will show reduced vertical mixing and weaker deep convection compared to the control, due to increased surface stratification. To analyze the results, I will examine time series of vertical temperature and salinity profiles and calculate overturning strength. I will also visualize the evolution of stratification and convection patterns using depth-averaged plots and vertical cross-sections.
